My Mac has Python 2.7:    Python 2.7.10 (default, Jul 14 2015, 19:46:27) 
04/09/2016: since it is already installed, I will learn python on 2.x. If I need to transition to Python 3.x, later, I will do so.
04/09/2016: Documentation for 3.3 is at: https://docs.python.org/3/
04/09/2016: Documentation for 2.7.113 is at: https://docs.python.org/2/
